KinesisAggRecord

Test Cases
- Need to test scenarios where we re-use the same partition key and reuse the same explicit hash key
- Test that listener fires properly
- Verify we can add a listener with a lambda

How do we tell a user their record failed? (is that even possible?)

Write Python deaggregator

//TODO: My pattern of sending the events on the "addUserRecord" call when a record no
//longer fits, but then wanting/needing to call "clear" in the Lambda does not work
--- Should I have two separate aggregators?  One batch and one lambda-based?
