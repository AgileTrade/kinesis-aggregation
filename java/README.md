# Java Kinesis Producer Library Deaggregation Module

This set of examples uses the UserRecord deaggregation capability that is implemented within the [Java KCL](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client), but as a standalone module that you can run within AWS Lambda. 

## Components

### Test Producers

The [KinesisTestProducers](KinesisTestProducers) project provides a simple way to inject some KPL aggregated data into a Stream, so that you can process it later. There is support for KPL and non-KPL producers.

### Lambda Consumers

The [KinesisLambdaTestConsumer](KinesisLambdaTestConsumer) project provides an example AWS Lambda Java project that shows how to use the `amazon-kinesis-client` UserRecord calss for deaggregation.

## Usage

To use this module, you create a Java Lambda function as normal, and then instantiate a [KplDeaggregator](KinesisLambdaTestConsumer/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/KplDeaggregator.java) instance. With this instance, you can use either a Java 8 Streams API function, or you can also perform deaggregation with the List API.

### Streams

With the Streams API approach, you provide a `Stream<KinesisEventRecord>` item, which can be created with the Lambda item `event.getRecords().stream()`. You also then provide a `Consumer<UserRecord>` instance to process the data. In the example, this is implemented as:


```
		// Stream the User Records from the Lambda Event
		deaggregator.stream(event.getRecords().stream(), userRecord -> {
			// Your User Record Processing Code Here!
				logger.log(String.format("Processing UserRecord %s (%s:%s)",
						userRecord.getPartitionKey(),
						userRecord.getSequenceNumber(),
						userRecord.getSubSequenceNumber()));
			});
```

For this interface, the Lambda handler will be specified as `com.amazonaws.KinesisLambdaReceiver`.

### Lists

If you'd prefer to work with Java Lists rather than Streams, you can also call the deaggregation interface `processRecords`. In this model you specify a `List<KinesisEventRecord>`, and an implementation of a `KplDeaggregator.KinesisUserRecordProcessor`, which implements the interface:

```
public Void process(List<UserRecord> userRecords)
```

For example:

```
deaggregator.processRecords(event.getRecords(),
					new KplDeaggregator.KinesisUserRecordProcessor() {
						public Void process(List<UserRecord> userRecords) {
							for (UserRecord userRecord : userRecords) {
								// Your User Record Processing Code Here!
								logger.log(String.format(
										"Processing UserRecord %s (%s:%s)",
										userRecord.getPartitionKey(),
										userRecord.getSequenceNumber(),
										userRecord.getSubSequenceNumber()));
							}

							return null;
						}
					});
```

For this interface, the Lambda handler will be specified as `com.amazonaws.KinesisLambdaReceiver::handleRequestsWithLists`.

## Build & Deploy

This project is provided as a Maven Module, so you can just execute a top level `maven install` and the producers and consumers will be built into their respective `target` directories, or you can alternatively just deploy the artefacts provided in the project `dist` directories:

Producers: [`KinesisTestProducers-1.0.0-dev.jar`](KinesisTestProducers/dist/KinesisTestProducers-1.0.0-dev.jar)

Consumers: [`KinesisLambdaTestConsumer-1.0.0-dev.jar`](KinesisLambdaTestConsumer/dist/KinesisLambdaTestConsumer-1.0.0-dev.jar)
